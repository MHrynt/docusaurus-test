Hello!

You can use the commit history on 'main' branch as an example on how to populate the project scaffolder with the content that you need. However, ignore the '/build' folder, you will not need to create it manually.

Here are a few tips on installing Docusaurus:

- use Git Bash terminal instead of Power Shell to run commands

- installing Node.js might be a problem, so don't lose hope if you don't succeed from the first time. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager and try different options that it suggests. If you keep seeing errors, try restarting terminal or VS Code. If the issues persis, try asking AI tools like ChatGPT or look for troubleshooting tips on the internet.


Here are a few tips using the Docusaurus project scaffolder after you create one:

- don't rush to delete the default folders with content, they have useful tutorials you might want to follow

- favicon, logo, and homepage images have to be in SVG format, otherwise you'll see an error
